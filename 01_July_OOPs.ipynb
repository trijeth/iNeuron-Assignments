      "source": "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to provide a programming paradigm that models real-world entities, relationships, and behaviors in a way that simplifies and enhances the software development process. It is designed to organize code into reusable, self-contained units called objects, each representing a specific entity or concept.\n\nThe four main principles that guide OOP are:\n\nEncapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes or properties) and the methods (functions or procedures) that operate on that data within a single unit, the object. It hides the internal implementation details of an object and exposes only the necessary interfaces, promoting information hiding and reducing system complexity.\n\nAbstraction: Abstraction focuses on defining a simplified interface for objects, where only the relevant features are exposed, and the underlying complexity is hidden. It allows developers to create generalized classes and then specialize them for specific use cases, leading to more modular and maintainable code.\n\nInheritance: Inheritance enables the creation of new classes (derived or child classes) based on existing classes (base or parent classes). The derived classes inherit the properties and behaviors of their parent classes, allowing code reuse and promoting the \"is-a\" relationship between objects.\n\nPolymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class or as instances of their specific derived classes. This flexibility allows the same method to be applied to different objects, even if they belong to different classes, making the code more flexible and extensible.",

It is implemented as a memory address in CPython, the default and most widely used implementation of Python. You can think of it as an object's \"address\" in memory. You can check the identity of an object using the id() function.\n\nState: The state of an object refers to the data (attributes or properties) it holds at a particular point in time.

      "source": "In Python class methods, the self parameter is a special parameter that refers to the instance of the class itself. It is the first parameter in most instance methods and serves as a reference to the object on which the method is called. The purpose of the self parameter is to access and manipulate the attributes and methods of the current instance.\n\nWhen you create an object from a class, Python automatically passes the instance as the first argument to any instance method you call on that object. By convention, the first parameter of instance methods is named self, but you can technically name it anything you like. However, using self is a widely followed convention in Python programming.\n\nHere's why the self parameter is important in class methods:\n\nAccessing instance variables:\nThe self parameter allows you to access and modify the instance variables (attributes) of the current object. By using self, you can distinguish between the instance variables of different objects of the same class. Without self, the method would not know which object's variables to refer to.\n\nCalling other methods:\nWhen you have multiple methods in a class, one method might need to call another method of the same object. In such cases, you need to use self to call other instance methods within the class.\n\nCreating new instance variables:\nIf you want to create new instance variables within a method, you can use self to do so. The new instance variables will be specific to the current object and won't affect other objects.\n\nCommunicating between methods:\nThe self parameter allows you to pass information between different methods within the same class. Methods can use self to store and retrieve information needed by other methods.",
